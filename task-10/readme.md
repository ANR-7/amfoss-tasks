## Task 10

I attempted one question and then moved on to other tasks first  
( I learnt that border-radius makes things rounded I guess)  
   
Then I came back to this and did all the rest four in one go.
Two properties that were a lifesaver and helped me finish this task with 2 hours left for submission were  
  
> inset: 0; margin: auto;
  
and
  
>box-shadow;

box-shadow is such a lifesaver omg i used it in all the tasks except the first one (sept 8) I think
