## Task 5

Functions were intuitive to do (without timer)  
Made it such that different functions return different params and then I add allat to a dictionary of params which I use to request questions  
     
Learn the usage of /r. I always knew it was a thing but live updating timer looks cool even though it has some problems  
     
Threading was annoying because threads cant break user input without other libraries  
So I had to resort to having the same if condition thrice  
          
The user has to press Enter after Timer ends
