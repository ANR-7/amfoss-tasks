Found habitable planet at EdmundPlanet hidden cave hidden branch

Got genetic as LnNoIHVzaW5nIHRoZSBwYXNzd29yZCBPaHRlbnNvdXJjZSwgYW5kIGFkZCBhIHNjcmVlbnNob3QgdG8gc29sdXJpb24ubWQ==

Then found message from them in Gargantua
The binary becomes base64 ZSwgYW5kIGFkZCBhIHNjcmVlbnNob3QgdG8gc29sdXRpbM1zLm1k

Then made a solve.sh after some googling on how openssl works. I didnt use base64 cause its not pre installed

Then had to fix the code of gravity.sh and set $LOCA_LOCA to Open_Source
