Took me a bit longer than I thought it was gonna take because of how rusty I was at git (It's been 2 years since I last used git)

## First Level

grep -r "facility"  
then cat to the file  
then rm the file  

T25lIGxhc3QgdGFzaywgYW5kIHlvdSdsbCBoYXZlIHN1Y2Nlc3NmdWxseSBjb21  

## Second Level 

cd Saturn  
cd Ring  
ls -a (shows hidden files)  
chmod +x .wormhole.sh  
./.wormhole.sh

## Third Level 

Found habitable planet at EdmundPlanet hidden cave hidden branch

Got genetic as LnNoIHVzaW5nIHRoZSBwYXNzd29yZCBPaHRlbnNvdXJjZSwgYW5kIGFkZCBhIHNjcmVlbnNob3QgdG8gc29sdXJpb24ubWQ==

## Fourth Level 

Then found message from them in Gargantua
The binary becomes base64 ZSwgYW5kIGFkZCBhIHNjcmVlbnNob3QgdG8gc29sdXRpbM1zLm1k

Then made a solve.sh after some googling on how openssl works. I didnt use base64 cause its not pre installed

Then had to fix the code of gravity.sh and set $LOCA_LOCA to Open_Source
