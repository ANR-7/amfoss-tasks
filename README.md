## Introduction

I am Aditya Narayan R. of CSE A batch, first year, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.  
I was a bio maths student but I've been programming for a while so I do know programming pretty well, but I'm still a bit rusty.   
My preferred language is Python but I've always wanted to learn Rust.  

## **Why should we choose you?**

I believe my attitude to always learn new things is the right attitude for a club like amfoss especially  
because the tech world is rapidly evolving and keeping up with it is essential if one wants to get an IT job.
