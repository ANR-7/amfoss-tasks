# amfoss-tasks

## Introduction
https://github.com/ANR-7/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-00
I am Aditya Narayan R. of CSE A batch, first year, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.  
I was a bio maths student but I've been programming for a while so I do know programming pretty well, but I'm still a bit rusty.   
My preferred language is Python but I've always wanted to learn Rust.  

## **Why should we choose you?**

I believe my attitude to always learn new things is the right attitude for a club like amfoss especially  
because the tech world is rapidly evolving and keeping up with it is essential if one wants to get an IT job.    
Also I love the fact that if I put genuine effort into this club, I can see a lot of places and meet new people  
and that will motivate me to put even more effort into this club creating a cycle which boosts the club.


## ** What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?**

I love all things programming (granted I suck at a lot of things programming) and anything challenging
in this domain interests me. I'm sure amfoss provides more than ample opportunity to find the specific
field I really can excel at and specialise in.
